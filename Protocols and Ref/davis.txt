Five to 7 days after surgery, the animals were anesthetized
and transcardially perfused with ice-cold paraformaldehyde
(4% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer). Both nodose ganglia and
paired dorsal root ganglia (T4–L2) were dissected,
embedded in 10% gelatin. The tissue was transferred into
0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) with 25% sucrose and stored
at 4C for at least 18 h, prior to our cutting sections
(35 lm) on a sliding microtome. Sections were washed
three times in 0.1 M PB, placed in phosphate-buffered
solution containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.25%
Triton X-100 (PBT) and then incubated overnight at room
temperature with antibodies against TRPV1 (raised in
rabbits; 1:500; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA; cat. #
PC420), CGRP (raised in rabbits; 1:2000; Chemicon,
Temecula, CA, USA; cat. # AB1971) and/or the neurofilament
heavy chain (generated from mouse ascites fluid;
1:400; N52, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA; cat. # N0142)
and/or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated isolectin Griffonia
simplifolica IB4 (1:100; IB4, Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA; cat. # I-32450). After being washed three times
in 0.1 M PB, sections were incubated for 2 h at room
temperature with secondary antibodies, donkey anti-rabbit
Cy3 or anti-mouse Cy5 (1:150; Jackson Immunoresearch,
West Grove, PA, USA). The sections were then washed
three times in 0.1 M PBT and mounted in 0.1% gelatin.

we performed immunohistochemical investigations,
using antibodies against the cationic ion channel
TRPV1 (capsaicin receptor) and the neuropeptide calcitonin
gene-related peptide (CGRP), which typically colocalizes
with the high-affinity receptor for nerve growth
factor (trkA) and is often used to identify potential peptidergic
nociceptiors [16, 18, 19]. To determine the fraction
of possible non-peptidergic nociceptors, we examined
binding of the plant isolectin IB4 [20]. Finally, we investigated
the presence of neurons with myelinated axons by
immunohistochemical staining for the neurofilament heavy
chain [21]. These neurochemical markers are frequently
used to classify sensory neurons, with TRPV1, CGRP, and
IB4 identifying subgroups thought to play a role in the
sensation of pain.

TRPV1 and CGRP - colocalizes with the high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor - used to identify potential peptidergic nociceptors

IB4 - non-pepdidergic nociceptors

Neurofilament - myelinated neurons

TRPV1, CGRP, IB4 - used to identify subgroups of sensory neurons involved in pain sensation
