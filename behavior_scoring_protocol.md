**Protocol for scoring awake ferret behavior:**   

Video recorded with Noldus Media Recorder software.   
Convert videos to AVI format before scoring.   

Videos are scored using BORIS software.   
Click ‘Open project’ under the ‘Project’ tab.   
Select the file ‘Ferret Behavior Scoring.boris’, found at [github link].   
The project will open with all the necessary event codes in place.   
	Keystrokes for each event are listed.   
	All events are point events.   
Select ‘New observation’ under the ‘Observation’ tab.   
Select the AVI version of the desired video, and name the observation file.   
Hit Start.   
Begin by hitting the keystroke for the first behavior, THEN hit play on the video.   
	This ensures there will not be lost time.   
Only hit a keystroke at the beginning of each new behavior.   
Continue until the video ends.   

**Notes:**   
A ‘retching’ event is scored as a single convulsion of the animal’s body during an emetic episode. Typically, there are several retches in succession--mark each of these.   
A ‘vomiting’ event is scored as the expulsion of stomach contents at the end of a series of retches.   
An ‘experimenter’ event is scored as a time when the experimenter’s body blocks the behavior of the ferret.   
The ‘Ensure’ event is used to mark both the introduction and removal of food.
